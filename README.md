Mapty is a web application that allows users to track and log their physical activities, such as running and cycling, on a map. 
The app uses the Geolocation API to determine the user's application and integrates with the Leaflet library to display maps. 
Users can input details about their workouts, which are then displayed on the map and stored locally for persistence.
